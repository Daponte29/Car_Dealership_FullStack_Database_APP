# Project Name:

Car_Dealership_FullStack_Database_APP


## Description:

This full stack application uses Python and the Tkinter GUI library to create a usable application for a hypothetical owner's car dealership business. The workflow consits of the Tkinter MVC architecture (https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-mvc/) to create the application. The functionalities and specifications of the application per the owner are described in the file named: 'Car Dealerhip -Requirements.docx'. The application uses the constructed schemas and associated initital sample data provided in the following files:
1.schema file: Folder['demo_data'] --> 'buzzcars_ddl_Demo_3.sql'
2.sample data file: Folder['demo_data'] --> 'buzzcars_demo_data_4.1.sql'


## How To Use:
- The database currently used on the APP is from Amazon Web Services(AWS) however if this database is not being recognized you can change the dbconfig to your own database after loading the schem and sample data files described in the description. the dbconfig variable is within the application folder 'util' --> 'db.py' where dbonfig is within the first function named 'start_connection_pool' on the 'db.py' file.
